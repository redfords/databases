Popularity of Hack
Facebook has developed a new programing language called Hack.To measure the popularity of Hack they
ran a survey with their employees. The survey included data on previous programing familiarity as well
as the number of years of experience, age, gender and most importantly satisfaction with Hack. Due to
an error location data was not collected, but your supervisor demands a report showing average popularity
of Hack by office location. Luckily the user IDs of employees completing the surveys were stored.
Based on the above, find the average popularity of the Hack per office location.
Output the location along with the average popularity.
